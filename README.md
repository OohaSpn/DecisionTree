This dataset includes two types of wine, red and white, with a total of 4,898 observations and 11 features. The target variable, quality, ranges from 3 to 11. This dataset is suitable for both classification and regression tasks. For this analysis, a decision tree classification model was implemented from scratch, achieving 94% accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Since the target variable was imbalanced, the SMOTE method was applied to balance the classes, resulting in an increased number of observations and a more uniform distribution. Additionally, the target variable was discretized into three labels: low, medium, and high.
