This dataset includes two types of wine, red and white, with a total of 4,898 observations and 11 features. The target variable, quality, ranges from 3 to 11. The dataset can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this analysis, decision tree classification was implemented from scratch. Since the target variable is imbalanced, the SMOTE technique was applied to balance the classes, resulting in an increased number of observations and a uniform distribution. Additionally, the target variable was discretized into three labels: low, medium, and high.
